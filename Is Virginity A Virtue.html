            <h4>Is Virginity A Virtue? 	Yukio Mishima<br>
處女是道德的嗎？		三島由紀夫<br>
            (from the Chinese translation by 邱振瑞 <i>Chiu Chen-jui</i>)<br></h4>
<p>I once heard a story that went like this. Before the war started, there were already lots of rich do-nothings in society. There was a group of these old money types, who, in the summer holidays, invited their male friends to have a wild time at this hotel in a summer resort. One of these rich girls was still a virgin, and so become the coveted goal of these “big bad wolves.” One evening, with her tolerance for alcohol as it was and having been poured lots to drink, she found herself being violated by one of these young guys in a room in the hotel.<br><br>
Stopping at this point, you could say this is a common situation. However, suppose that this guy was too young and couldn’t properly complete the act, and more just finishes half-heartedly. But also that this rich girl doesn’t know what’s really happened, and when she wakes up the next morning resolutely believes that she has now lost her virginity. Not long later, when that rich girl and some other guy are engaged to marry, right up to the point of happy wedding bells there is still something which makes her feel uneasy, which is that she isn’t a virgin anymore. This matter keeps her worried day and night; her spirit is almost crushed; she just barely keeps from ending her life. Finally, her wedding night arrives. What happens completely exceeds this rich girl’s expectations, that the groom is moved by her chastity, and his being moved immediately makes her dumbfounded.<br><br>
With things progressing to this point, there is really no meaning in examining whether she is still a virgin in terms of flesh or biology. In fact, you could say she has lost her virginity on two occasions – the first time mentally, the second time physically. However on the second occasion of losing her virginity, it’s not just that she was no longer a virgin in her head, <u>but rather that she didn’t know that she was still a virgin.</u> <br><br>
There used to be this popular term “half virgin” to describe women that still knew lots about the matters of sex between men and women despite still physically being virgins. Women with no sense of shame.<br><br>
Humanity has two concurrent sides, that of the flesh and the mind, whose structures are complex and a bother. That story of the rich girl just now is then derived from a misunderstanding of the psychological and physiological. With humanity being the sort of being he is, if he doesn’t misunderstand his own body, then it is some aspect of his mind that he misunderstands, and vice versa. Therefore, this so-called rhetoric of “virginity” is thoroughly physiological jargon, only having meaning in some physiological aspect. Supposing one insists on this word, to apply it in terms of moral worth, then awkward straightened circumstances will arise. Therefore, I decidedly don’t speak of the kind of language like “she is already not a virgin, so she is an unvirtuous woman.”<br><br>
    And as for an example of those who have no misunderstanding of the physical body, but whose mentality is full of misunderstanding, that would be a hooker. They are very clear that their bodies can be paid for in exchange for money. At the same time, they also constrain themselves in this stereotypical framing of “hooker,” limiting their autonomy as a human being.<br><br>
    The opposite situation arises with virgins. The aforementioned rich girl is a good example. The misunderstanding of her body is a key characteristic of a virgin. Is one a virgin after all or not? Is one’s virginal hymen still intact or not? Suppose she carefully and seriously goes into it, then she can only feel it’s more and more troublesome. In fact, what does it mean to not understand your own body? Even if they have read books, conferred with other people, they still won’t understand. In other words, they decidedly don’t misunderstand on a mental level. No matter if it is any one virgin, whether beautiful or ugly, they all sincerely affirm that they possess clear and happy prospects.<br><br>
