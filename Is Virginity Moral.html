            Is virginity moral? 	Yukio Mishima<br>
處女是道德的嗎？		三島由紀夫<br>
I once heard a story that went like this. Before the war started, there were already lots of rich do-nothings in society. There was a group of these old money types, in the summer holidays, who invited their male friends to have a wild time at this hotel in a summer resort. One of these rich girls was still a virgin, and so become the coveted goal of these “big bad wolves.” One evening, with her tolerance for alcohol as it was, and having been poured lots to drink, she found herself being violated by one of these young guys in a room in the hotel.<br>
Stopping at this point, you could say this is a common situation. However, perhaps if this guy is too young, he couldn’t properly complete the act, and more just finishes half-heartedly. But that rich girl doesn’t know what’s really happened, and when she wakes up the next morning resolutely believes that she has now lost her virginity. Not long later, when that rich girl and some other guy are engaged to marry, right up to the point of happy wedding bells, there is still something which makes her feel uneasy, which is that she isn’t a virgin anymore. This matter keeps her worried day and night; her spirit is almost crushed; she just barely keeps from ending her life. Finally, her wedding night arrives. The result completely exceeds this rich girl’s expectations, that the groom is moved by her chastity, and his being moved immediately makes her dumbfounded.<br>
Things progressing to here, examining whether she is still a virgin in terms of flesh of physiology if, really has no meaning. In fact, you could say she had lost her virginity on two occasions – the first time psychologically, the second time physiologically. However on the second time of losing her virginity, it’s not just that she was no longer mentally a virgin, <u>but rather that she didn’t know that she was still a virgin.</u> <br>
There once used to be this popular term “half virgin,” to describe women that despite still physically being virgins, in their mind’s domains still knew lots about matters of sex between men and women, these women with no sense of shame.
Mankind possesses at the same time two aspects, that of the flesh and of the mind, whose structure is both complex and a bother.
