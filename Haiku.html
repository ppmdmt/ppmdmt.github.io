<p><i>I scrawled these haikus down onto my notepad on the bus coming down from Yangmingshan back into Taipei. It was a warm for Taiwan, but made cold by being up a mountain, and it had begun to rain just before I walked to the bus stop. The wind began to pick up too.</i></p>
<p class="one">
Yangmingshan rises<br>
The rain taps the window of<br>
the bus descending<br>
<br>
Stepping over grates<br>
Hot air rises beneath me<br>
Cool breeze hits my face<br>
<br>
Damp bag in my lap<br>
I am safe from mountain rain<br>
Taipei is so hot</p>

<p><i>A couple weeks later, I was visiting the town of Hsinchu about an hour from Taipei. I found myself watching a public performance of some Chinese opera show, that was being hosted just outside the front of a temple.</i></p>

Hsinchu summer sun<br>
Roaring temple fire fuels<br>
Opera viewerâ€™s sweat</p>
