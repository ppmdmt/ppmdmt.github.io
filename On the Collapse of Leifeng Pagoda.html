            <h4>論雷峰塔的倒掉<br>
                On the Collapse of Leifeng Pagoda<br>
		by Lu Xun<br></h4>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Lu Xun (1881 to 1936) is perhaps the most famous 20th century Chinese author: a pioneer of writing in the vernacular language (<i>bai hua wen</i>) as opposed to the pre-Republican custom of writing in Classical Chinese (<i>wen yan</i>). He was a prominent leftist and prolific writer of essays and short stories.<br>
<i>On the Collapse of Leifeng Pagoda</i> is a meditative essay written by Lu Xun near the end of 1924, in reaction to the titular collapse of the Leifeng Pagoda in Hangzhou, which had occurred on the 25th of September of that same year. He argues that the collapse of the pagoda is a symbolic moment for China, symbolic in the sense that the collapse of the pagoda represented the collapse of the old order, the collapse of old feudalistic Chinese society. It is worth remembering that the 1920s was a very tumultuous time for China, caught in an era of warlords; after the fall of the Qing dynasty and still waiting for another movement of unification.<br>
Throughout the essay, Lu Xun discusses the story of <i>The Legend of the White Snake</i>, one of China’s most famous folk tales. The main characters include: Madame White Snake (which is what he refers to her as, though she goes by other names, including her personal name: Bai Suzhen), Xu Xian, and Fahai (a monk). The plot of the legend should be apparent.</p>

        <h4>On the Collapse of Leifeng Pagoda</h4>
<p>I have heard that Leifeng Pagoda, on the West Lake in Hangzhou, has collapsed. I’ve only heard this; I haven’t seen it myself. But I have seen Leifeng Pagoda before its collapse, a worn out reflection hidden between scenic lakes and mountains, with the sun behind the mountain illuminating these surroundings. This is the ‘Leifeng sunset,’ one of the ten sights of the West Lake. I have also seen this ‘Leifeng sunset,’ by no means an excellent sight, in my opinion. <br><br>
    However, among the list of all the famous historical sites on the West Lake, the one I knew about first was the Leifeng Pagoda. My grandmother often used to tell me that Madame White Snake was trapped underneath this pagoda! There was a man called Xu Xian who saved two snakes, one green and one white. And then the white snake, in order to pay a debt of gratitude, turned into a woman and married Xu Xian; the green snake became a servant-girl and went with him too. A monk, Fahai, who had achieved Dao, saw a sinister appearance on the face of Xu Xian, ¬– ordinarily a person marrying a spirit will have a happy expression on his face, for only an extraordinary person of ability will be able to perceive this – so hid him behind the ceremonial chair<sup>1</sup> in Jinshan Temple. Madame White Snake came to find her husband, and consequently “flooded Jinshan.” My grandmother would speak about still more interesting things, probably taken from the Suzhou opera called “The Fairy of Justice,” but I haven’t read this, and so I don’t know whether ‘Xu Xian’ or ‘Fahai’ are written this way. In short, Madame White Snake is finally struck by Fahai’s plan and trapped in a very small alms bowl. The alms bowl is buried in the ground, and a defensive tower is further built on top, and this then is the Leifeng Pagoda. After this the stories are seemingly numerous, such as the sort like “Top Scholar Sacrifices at the Pagoda,” but now I’ve forgotten them all.<br><br>
    At that time my only hope was this collapse of the Leifeng Pagoda. Later when I had grown up, been to Hangzhou and seen this worn out pagoda, I felt uncomfortable. Afterwards I read books, which said the people of Hangzhou call this pagoda the ‘protect Chu pagoda,’ which really should be written ‘protect Chu<sup>2</sup> pagoda,’ and that it was built by the son of King Qian. Then, there is naturally no Madame White Snake inside it. However I still felt uncomfortable, still hoping for its collapse.<br><br>
    Now that it has collapsed unexpectedly, why are all the people under heaven happy?<br><br>
    This is something that can really be verified. Go try the mountains and coasts in Wuyue<sup>3</sup> and listen closely to the opinion of the people. Everywhere there are farmers, village elders, silk-workers, yokels, and apart from a few with problems with their heads, who doesn’t feel outraged at the injustice towards Madame White Snake, and doesn’t blame so many things on Fahai?<br><br>
    A monk should just worry himself with reading scripture. The White Snake confused Xu Xian, and it was Xu Xian that married this spirit, so what does someone else have to do with it? Yet he insists on putting down his scrolls and stirring up trouble, probably because of jealousy, – that’s simply certain.<br><br>
    I’ve heard that afterwards the Jade Emperor also blamed many things on Fahai, including even plunging the people into depths of suffering, and he wanted to apprehend and punish him. He fled, finally escaping into a crab shell to avoid misfortune. And not daring to go out again, he is still there even now. Of all the things I have done regarding the Jade Emperor, many are unspoken criticism, but only with this thing am I satisfied, because “flooding Jinshan” certainly ought to be blamed on Fahai; what he did was actually very wrong. It’s just a shame that at that time I hadn’t asked about the source of this saying. Perhaps it is not in “The Fairy of Justice,” but is just said among the people.<br><br>
    In high autumn when the rice paddies are in season, there are many crabs in Wuyue. And after being cooked red, no matter which one you take, open up the shell and there is yellow inside, and it’s creamy; supposing it’s female, then it will have fresh red eggs like pomegranate seeds. First eat all of these, then a round conical film will be revealed. Then using a small knife, carefully cut along the bottom of this film and take it out, turn it over, turn it inside out, just don’t break it. Then it will become something that looks like a <i>luohan</i><sup>4</sup>, with a head and face, a body, sat; the children there all call it a “crab monk” – it’s Fahai hiding inside to take refuge.<br><br>
    Originally, Madame White Snake was trapped under the pagoda and Monk Fahai hidden inside a crab shell. Now there is only this monk alone, sat still, until that day that won’t come where there are no more crabs. Is it possible that when he built that pagoda, he didn’t think that it might finally fall down?<br><br>
    Serves him right.<br><br>
    (28th October 1924)

            <li>法座 lit. dharma seat, a gilt throne from which a Buddhist spiritual leader might share teachings</li>
            <li>Lu Xun writes these two characters for Chu differently: the first as ‘叔’, the second correctly as ‘俶’</li>
            <li>Wuyue was a kingdom in Eastern China centred on Hangzhou, and it was King Qianchu of Wuyue who first built the Leifeng Pagoda in 977 AD. Wuyue is probably meant here to denote the area around Shanghai and Zhejiang provinces</li>
            <li>A <i>luohan</i> or <i>arhat</i> is, in Buddhism, a person who has achieved enlightenment and escaped the cycle of rebirth. Lu Xun is alluding to the common depiction of the <i>luohan</i> sat in a meditative position</li>
