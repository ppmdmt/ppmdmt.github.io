<p class="one">
    There once was a young man from Leith<br>
Who one day went up to the heath<br>
In exchange for some drugs<br>
He offered some tugs<br>
And instead got a fist in his teeth<br><br>

There once was a man from the States<br>
Who at parties just stands there and waits<br>
For a woman to watch<br>
Quite close at his crotch<br>
Til it moves in a way that she hates
